# My Web App

Welcome to my web app! This is a simple javascript web application to display a social media feed. It has functionality to sign in / sign up for an account, update the password, create and like posts, comment on a post, and follow or unfollow users. 

# How I built my app
I built my app using primarily javascript, CSS, and HTML. I used the React and Axios libraries for my front end and Node js as the framework for my backend. I also used the Sequelize library for object relational mapping.

# Directions
* Clone repository locally
* To deploy locally, navigate to the /server and /client directories, and run the command npm run start in both paths.

# Features 
* Once opening the app, use the sign in page to create a few accounts for users. 
* When signed in, you can create a post using the form at the top of the page.
* On the post, you can view the number of likes, and select the icon to like the post. Click on the post text or the comment icon to view the comment section. You can post a comment here, or delete comments that you have made.
* At the top right, you can see buttons to view the home or explore pages. View the home page to see all posts from you or users you follow. View the explore page to view all posts.
* On the explore page, click on a user's username or picture to view their profile. On their profile page, you can see whether or not you follow the user. Try following / unfollowing users to view their posts on your home page.

# Enjoy!
